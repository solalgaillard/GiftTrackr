# GiftTrackr

Created at AngelHack Washington D.C. Hackathon 2018 - with https://github.com/CameronPennington & https://github.com/ayouth
Prototype for an App binding customers, retailers and charities together.

The idea is to let charities tell people what they are in need of so they can buy the items for them.
